Quick Event Calendar is a very simple, performant and WordPress-integrated event calendar plugin. Quick Event Calendar allows you to add posts, events or any other custom post type to a flexible, responsive calendar which can be placed in a post, page or widget.

The calendar works on one page only using AJAX loading. All events (or posts) in one month are displayed under the calendar. It is simple, fast, with no bloated styles and visual scripts. Use the included themes to style your calendar. Use the default or the minimal theme to match your current WordPress theme appearance.

The calendar is feature-packed: works with custom posts, only needs one page, includes predefined themes and is responsive.

Add your own event using the `[qcc-form]` shortcode and display all events using the `[qcc-calendar]` shortcode.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `qcc-calendar` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin via the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. A new Quick Event Calendar menu will appear in WordPress Settings with options and general help

= Help with shortcodes =

Use the `[qcc-calendar]` shortcode in any post, page or widget to show the calendar.
Use the `[qcc-form]` shortcode in any post, page or widget to show the calendar submission form.

= Help with template tags =

Use the `<?php echo do_shortcode("[qcc-calendar]"); ?>` code in any page template to show the calendar.
Use the `<?php echo do_shortcode("[qcc-form]"); ?>` code in any page template to show the calendar submission form.

= Help with styling =

Use the included themes to style your calendar. Use the default or the minimal theme to match your current WordPress theme appearance.

After installing the plugin, you need to configure it by selecting several options:

Select the desired post type, select the desired category (if post type is 'post') and select which posts you want to show. For an event calendar, the default should be both published and scheduled/future posts.

In case you want to use custom meta fields, the calendar works with preexisting meta fields. Using custom meta fields requires a third-party plugin to add new fields.

After selecting the desired options, pick one of the predefined themes to match your site.

After selecting a theme, you need to match your site's colours with the calendar template.

In your Configurator tab, select the accent colour, the event colour and the background colour for the current day.

When you are done with the settings, use the `[qcc-calendar]` shortcode in any post, page or widget to show the calendar.
